# Containerization with Docker

## Description
A fully containerized application using **Docker** and **Docker Compose** to manage multiple services. The project demonstrates the containerization of backend, frontend, and database services.

## Features
- Dockerfiles for backend and frontend.
- Multi-container orchestration with Docker Compose.
- Environment isolation for easy deployment.

## What I Learned
- Writing Dockerfiles for Node.js applications.
- Using Docker Compose to manage multi-service setups.
- Debugging and managing containers with Docker CLI.

## Setup
1. Build and run containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   
2. Access the services:
Frontend: http://localhost:3000
Backend: http://localhost:4000
